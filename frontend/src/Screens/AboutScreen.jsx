                    <p>
                        Welcome to our handmade crochet store! I'm a 28-year-old Tampa native 
                        that has been crocheting for 7 years, and I'm excited to finally open my 
                        own store.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        It all started when I made my first blanket for my beloved abuela, and from 
                        there I fell in love with the craft. I enjoy working with hand-dyed yarn and 
                        take pride in supporting smaller yarn shops.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        When I'm not busy crocheting, you can find me enjoying the beautiful beaches of 
                        Tampa or spending a day at Disney World. I'm also a proud dog mom to Ranger, who 
                        is always by my side during my crochet sessions.
                    </p>
